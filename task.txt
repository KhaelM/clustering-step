Step 1(swap):
    Alternates between server when user makes a request

Step 2(session stickiness):
    As long as there is a session on a defined server, the user request should always be redirected to this server
    otherwise it switches to another one

Step 3: (Database backup)
    Master:
    Slave1
    Slave2

If an edit is performed inside Master (database creation, table creation), it should be propagated to the slaves
Slaves 'select' request should return the same data as the Master

Step 4:
    Master1 - Master2

Each edit made to Master1 should also edit Master2 contents and vice versa

Step 5:
            Ha Proxy
            (Http)
        /       |           \
    Server1     Server2     Server3
                |
            HaProxy
            (Database - TCP)
        /       |           \
    Database1    Database2  Database3
