 We'll use mariadb (mysql fork)
To avoid problem, the version should be the same

Say we have 2 computer with xampp installed :
pc1: 192.168.88.10 ==> Master (Ubuntu)
pc2: 192.168.88.61 ==> Slave1 (Windows 10)

Master config:
    Add to mariadb config (/opt/lampp/etc/my.cnf on Ubuntuor D:\Server\mysql\bin\my.ini on Windows 10)
    under [mysqld] section:
        server-id = 1
        log-bin=master-bin
        log-bin-index=master-bin.index

        comment using # bin-address=blabla if not commented to avoid listening on specific address

    restart xampp mariadb
        Ubuntu:
            sudo ./xampp stopmysql
            sudo ./xampp startmysql
        
        Windows 10:
            Open xampp control as admin and stop, then start mysql then open a shell

        mysql -u root
        create user 'replica'@'%' identified by 'password';
        GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'replica'@'%';
	GRANT all privileges ON *.* TO 'replica'@'%';
        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
        show master status;
        keep note of information

Slaves config:
    Edit mariadb config as master but with other server-id, for example here:
        server-id = 2

    Restart xampp mariadb as admin
    
    mysql -u root
    stop slave;

    enter next command with correct information:
        CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST = '192.168.43.240',
        MASTER_USER = 'replica',
        MASTER_PASSWORD = 'password',
        MASTER_LOG_FILE = 'master-bin.000003',
        MASTER_LOG_POS = 763;

        (If there is a problem with slave, enter: RESET SLAVE ALL;) ==> this command deletes every slave

    start slave;
    
    to check if there is no error:
        show slave status;


disconnect both master and slave from mysql then reconnect Master to mysql

create new database, connect slave to mysql and the previous database should appear
