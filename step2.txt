keep step1 /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg: and add on backend section:
    cookie COOKIENAME insert
    server pc2  192.168.1.13:80 cookie pc1CookieValue
    server pc3  192.168.1.14:80 cookie pc2CookieValue
    server pc4  192.168.1.15:80 cookie pc3CookieValue

alternatively if we don't want to create other cookie for session stickiness (not tested yet)
    cookie PHPSESSID prefix #instead of cookie COOKIENAME insert
    maybe delete cookie pc1CookieValue

create a session.php on each server:

<?php
header('Content-Type: text/plain');
session_start();
if(!isset($_SESSION['visit']))
{
        echo "This is the first time you're visiting this server";
        $_SESSION['visit'] = 0;
}
else
        echo "Your number of visits: ".$_SESSION['visit'];

$_SESSION['visit']++;

echo "\nServer IP: ".$_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR'];
echo "\nClient IP: ".$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
echo "\nX-Forwarded-for: ".$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']."\n";
print_r($_COOKIE);
?>

As long as there is a cookie in a server, user's response always comes from this one
